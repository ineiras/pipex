# pipex
Pipex is a Unix-based project where I recreated the behavior of shell piping (|) by chaining commands through inter-process communication. The goal was to deepen my understanding of process creation, file descriptor manipulation, and command execution using system calls like pipe(), fork(), and execve() in C.
